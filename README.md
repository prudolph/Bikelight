Bikelight
=============
This project is a first attempt at creating a bike light that automatically turns on when motion is detected and will be capable of detecting decelleration to trigger brake lights. The main goals of this project is to help minize getting run over by crazy philly drivers. (And allow me to never have to remeber to bring my lights along.)

Project Plan
-Forward white lights and Rear red lights turn on and off based motion detection. 
-Recognize decelleration to show brake lights
-Run effiecently enough to run on adafruit trinket and small 150Mah lipo Battery
